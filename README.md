# Flight-Booking-Airflow-CICD
Flight Booking Data Pipeline with Airflow and CICD 

## Introduction
This industrial project implements a scalable data pipeline to process flight booking data using PySpark on Dataproc Serverless, orchestrated through Airflow. Transformed data is loaded into BigQuery for business insights, while a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions ensures seamless and automated code deployment to both development and production environments.
